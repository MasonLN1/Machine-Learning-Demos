# Machine-Learning-Demos
Minor projects and algorithms ported during work throughout my academic program.

This repository is dedicated to collecting a portion of our work completed during Memorial University of Newfoundland's Master of Data Science program.
For easy visualization, we include a selection of notebook and markdown files that highlight some core concepts and analytical findings rather than
some of our isolated codes utilized throughout our courses.

Summaries
---
BreastCancerDEMO
A detailed analysis of a breast cancer tumour dataset, focused on utilizating data imputation and principle component analysis within classification models.
Possible adjustments: Alternative models and hyperparameter tuning, ideally focusing on ensemble models such as a Random Forest over a Decision Tree.

CHDDetectionDEMO
A detailed analysis of coronary heart disease, focused on identifying feature importance and experimenting with various model architechtures.
Possible adjustments: More comprehensive Neural Network models, prevent overfitting using intelligent learning rates and early stopping calls.

ConcreteAnalysisDEMO
Identification of an ideal concrete formula to maximize concrete strength
Possible adjustments: Consider non-linear models (though the data visualization demonstrated strong linear relationships between our features and target).

DegausserDEMO
Construction of an AI model that can unblur images that with known (or approximated) blur parameters.
Possible adjustments: Include non-gaussian blurred images in the training data to expand the model to accomodate different types of blur.

L2penaltyWrapperDEMO
Incorporation of an L2 penalty method on a gradient descent optimizer algorithm to demonstrate boundary conditions.
Possible adjustments: Include more examples and plots.

OptimizerVisualizationDEMO
A tool created to trace the path at each step of various gradient descent-based algorithms to preview stability and speed of convergence across several optimizers
Possible adjustments: Explore highly pathological examples.

ResNeXtDEMO
The best performing model architechture demonstrated in class for a given task was improved by using a novel model architechture from scratch that featured decreased training time and improved accuracy
Possible adjustments: Explore beyond ResNeXt; various CNNs exist that are based off of ResNet that can be tested.

SuperresolutionDEMO
Construction of an AI model that can scale images larger without degrading the quality by predicting the patterns that would occur in the stretched pixels.
Possible adjustments: Test more variation to scaling parameters (example: scale horizontally by a factor of 3, and vertically by a factor of 1.5).
